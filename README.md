**`Digital Apprentice (Software Engineer)`**

If you're here, welcome! I'm just an average guy who really enjoys not just
Computer Science, but programming as well! Every project I do is meticulously thought 
out, all the way from the conceptualization and designing all the way to solving real-life 
problems with code. I record my learning process on my YouTube channel "[vp_SWE](https://www.youtube.com/@vp_SWE)" to try and not only be
able to reflect on previous accomplishments, but to try and motivate others to pursue their dreams.
